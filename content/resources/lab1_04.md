description: 'In this laboratory exercise, we will examine several different ways
  of doing spectral analysis of

  speech, and we will collect some acoustic data from a few vowels and consonants.
  These data will be compared with data reported in the literature and will be interpreted
  in terms of speech-production

  theories described in class.'
